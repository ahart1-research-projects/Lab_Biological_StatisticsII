# Lab_Biological_StatisticsII
This repository contains my homework and lab files from UMass Dartmouthâ€™s Biological Statistics II (taught by Gavin Fay and Steve Cadrin in Spring 2016). Lab and homework examples use R to run statistical analyses and include a general introduction to R coding and graphics.
